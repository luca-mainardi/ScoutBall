## Overview
This is the project for the course Visualization (JBI100), Eindhoven University of Technology.

ScoutBall is a football scouting tool that integrates data analysis with visualizations, focusing on key performance parameters of both players on the pitch and goalkeepers. Developed with a primary emphasis on visualization, ScoutBall provides insights into defensive and offensive contributions, allowing scouts to identify well-rounded players and conduct detailed comparative analyses.

## Key Features
- **Data Analytics:** Utilize data analytics techniques to assess player performance comprehensively and visualize key performance metrics through interactive data visualizations.
- **Player Comparison:** Compare players based on position-specific metrics using radar charts for a comprehensive overview.
- **Geographical Distribution Analysis:** Explore the geographical distribution of players of interest through choropleth maps.
- **Interactive Features:** Engage with interactive components for enhanced user experience and detailed information uncovering.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dataset Updates:** Commitment to updating the dataset with future sports competitions and expanding it to include new types of competitions.
- **Performance Metrics Expansion:** Introduction of additional performance metrics to enrich analysis with a broader skill spectrum.
- **Scalability:** Ensuring scalability of the solution to handle growing volumes of data without compromising performance or user experience.
